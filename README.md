# artist-identification
Project aiming to perform artist identification from paintings via a neural network.

As a note, my computer currently has a GTX 980 installed, which I normally use to play video games, that I leverage for training my neural networks. For use without cuda, one simply needs to remove the .cuda() calls sprinkled throughout the code.
